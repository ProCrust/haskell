# PROCRUST's HASKELL REPOSITORY

This is a repository for Haskell source codes. This repository is created by Kent Joash A. Zamudio (@ProCrust) for the term paper in CMSC124 - Design and Implementation of Programming Languages, as well as, for future projects.

Some codes are derived from exercises from Real World Haskell book and others are @ProCrust's own exercise codes.

### NOTE:
Source codes were created using Haskell-Stack and compiled using Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler (ghc).
